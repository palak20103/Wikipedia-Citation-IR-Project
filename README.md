Similar Content Retrieval From Wikipedia Citation

The drastic growth in the content available on the web has been observed in the past few years. Wikipedia saw exponential growth since 2006,
and the total number of articles on the site reached 55 million, out of which 6.2 million are in English. 
This massive collection of articles poses new kinds of difficulties to users, such as retrieving semantically similar information.
As lexically similar texts may not relate semantically like food and bread are semantically equivalent however lexically different.
It is time-consuming to visit various cited links and read content manually when the data is vast and diverse.
Even if we try reading content manually, not all cited text is relevant, leading to wastage of time.
Sometimes the user needs context to the quoted text and requires to search manually for the cited text and may end up getting some relevant data or may deviate from the context.
This problem needs the system to be more imaginative and efficient and increase the user readability and experience.


We aim to propose an information retrieval system that would retrieve semantically similar data from the noted link,
noted link here means Wikipedia's highlighted internal links and external citations.
We propose to make a chrome extension plugin which will return the most relevant article from citations based on user's query.
Our approach will save users precious time by not surfing over and over for the cited context. It helps the user to extract the vital information more engagingly. 
It also avoids the situation when the user visits multiple articles for the cited text and may often deviate from the context. 
This will enhance the overall knowledge of the context of the user as well.
